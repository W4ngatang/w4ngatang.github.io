---

My name is Alex. I am a PhD student at NYU studying computer science, focusing on machine learning for natural language.
I am advised by Professors [Kyunghyun Cho](http://www.kyunghyuncho.me/) and [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/).
I graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor's in applied mathematics and a master's in computer science, where I was advised by [Alexander Rush](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/rush.html).
See my [CV](/static/CV-08-18-2018.pdf), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=7lSuRloAAAAJ), [GitHub](https://github.com/W4ngatang) for more details.

### Other Projects

- [A Neural Framework for One-Shot Learning](https://github.com/W4ngatang/MatchingNets): thorough examination in the use of [matching networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080), a neural network and nonparametric model hybrid, for one-shot learning in various settings. See [paper](/static/thesis.pdf) for more details. Completed for my senior thesis, earning high honors. I was advised by Professor [Alexander Rush](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~srush/), whom I was fortunate to be mentored by for several semesters.
- [Learning Linguistic Descriptors of User Roles in Online Communities](https://github.com/W4ngatang/Embeddit): recurrent neural network model for unsupervised learning of descriptors of social interactions on online communities such as Reddit based of user comments. See [paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-5610) for details.
- [Traffic Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/W4ngatang/TrafficSwarmOptimization): investigation in the use of swarm optimization methods for optimizing traffic light cycles. For more info see this [article](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2016/06/ants-go-marching-on-to-optimize-traffic-lights) or this [writeup](/static/swarm-optimization-traffic.pdf). Made for AM 221.
- [Gaussian Processes for Crime Prediction](https://github.com/kandluis/crime-prediction): an exploration into the use of Gaussian processes to predict future crime rates in cities. See the [writeup](/static/gaussian-processes-crime.pdf) for details. Made for CS 281.
- [Twitter Plays Chess](https://github.com/mgentili/TwitterPlaysChess): crowdsourced chess playing against an AI where users vote for the human team's next move via Twitter, &agrave; la Twitch Plays Pokemon. Made for CS 186. 
- Intern at Microsoft. Published an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AzureML/index.html) to programmatically access Microsoft Azure Machine Learning ([more info](http://blogs.technet.com/b/machinelearning/archive/2015/09/25/build-and-deploy-a-predictive-web-app-using-rstudio-and-azure-ml.aspx)). Summer 2015.
