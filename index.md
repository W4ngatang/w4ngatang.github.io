I am a PhD student at New York University studying computer science, focusing on machine learning for natural language.
I am jointly advised by Professors [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/) and [Kyunghyun Cho](http://www.kyunghyuncho.me/), and am part of the [Machine Learning for Language](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/) group at NYU.
I graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor's in applied mathematics and a master's in computer science, where I was advised by [Alexander Rush](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/rush.html) and spent time with the [Harvard Natural Language Processing](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/) group.
See my [CV](/static/CV-08-18-2018.pdf), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=7lSuRloAAAAJ), [GitHub](https://github.com/W4ngatang) for more details.

### News

We are currently soliciting feedback (especially proposals of tasks to include, but also comments and concerns) for the next version of GLUE.
More details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y5Yc5tTumKw-3Rt6Sb_ESh_JUjPu28iTL9Fat-uNb-4).

### Other Projects

- [A Neural Framework for One-Shot Learning](https://github.com/W4ngatang/MatchingNets): thorough examination in the use of [matching networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080), a neural network and nonparametric model hybrid, for one-shot learning in various settings. See [paper](/static/thesis.pdf) for more details. Completed for my senior thesis, earning high honors.
- [Traffic Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/W4ngatang/TrafficSwarmOptimization): investigation in the use of swarm optimization methods for optimizing traffic light cycles. For more info see this [article](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2016/06/ants-go-marching-on-to-optimize-traffic-lights) or this [writeup](/static/swarm-optimization-traffic.pdf).
- [Gaussian Processes for Crime Prediction](https://github.com/kandluis/crime-prediction): an exploration into the use of Gaussian processes to predict future crime rates in cities. See the [writeup](/static/gaussian-processes-crime.pdf) for details.
- [Twitter Plays Chess](https://github.com/mgentili/TwitterPlaysChess): crowdsourced chess playing against an AI where users vote for the human team's next move via Twitter, &agrave; la Twitch Plays Pokemon.
