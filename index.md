I am a recently graduated PhD student from New York University studying computer science, focusing on machine learning for natural language.
I am jointly advised by Professors [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/) and [Kyunghyun Cho](http://www.kyunghyuncho.me/), and am part of the [Machine Learning for Language](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/) group at NYU.
I graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor's in applied mathematics and a master's in computer science, where I was advised by [Alexander Rush](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/rush.html) and spent time with the [Harvard Natural Language Processing](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/) group.
See my [CV](/static/CV.pdf), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=7lSuRloAAAAJ), [GitHub](https://github.com/W4ngatang) for more details.
