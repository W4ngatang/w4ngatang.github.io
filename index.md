My name is Alex. I'm a PhD student at NYU studying computer science, specifically machine learning for natural language and vision. I am advised by Kyunghyung Cho and Sam Bowman. I graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor's in applied mathematics and a master's in computer science.

### Experience

A sketch of my professional history; see LinkedIn for more details.

- Summer '16: Research intern with Professor [Jure Leskovec](http://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) and [Will Hamilton](https://stanford.edu/~wleif/) through the [Center for the Study of Language and Information](https://www-csli.stanford.edu/), Stanford University. Published "[Learning Linguistic Descriptors of User Roles in Online Communities](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-5610.pdf) to [NLP+CSS](https://sites.google.com/site/nlpandcss/nlpcss-at-emnlp-2016)"  ([code](https://github.com/W4ngatang/Embeddit)) at EMNLP 2016.
- Summer '15: Intern at Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. Published an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AzureML/index.html) for programmatic access to Microsoft Azure ([more info](http://blogs.technet.com/b/machinelearning/archive/2015/09/25/build-and-deploy-a-predictive-web-app-using-rstudio-and-azure-ml.aspx)).
- Summer '14: summer analyst at [Endeavour Partners](http://endeavourpartners.net/)
