# Gift Ideas

A good gift is hard to find, especially for me.
Generally if I want something, I'll buy it for myself.

My general philosophy for gifts is to get something that the person doesn't know about but I know they would enjoy, or get something that person knows of and would enjoy, but would never get for themselves.
That philosophy would work well in buying gifts for me.

## Random Things

* (physical) soundboard
* adjustable dumbbell / weight
* lawn games, e.g. bocce, especially if they are not really big and hard to store / transport
* Sony wH1000XM4, ideally the blue variant
* Pixel 7 phone stand + charger
* MTG
    * gift bundles are totally great
    * unique and good draft boxes
    * fancy: commissioned alters of my favorite cards


## Experiences

I am generally in favor of experiential gifts because I have too much stuff.

* unique shows, performances, etc. Some examples: Batsu, Too Much Light Blinds the Baby
* coaching: basketball
* classes: cooking, mixology/bartending
