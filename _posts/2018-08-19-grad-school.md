# Who This is For 

This blog post is intended for people interested that have already decided to apply to graduate school (PhD programs) or are generally interested in seeing what the process entails.

There are a lot of resources for both deciding to go to grad school and actually applying to grad school.
Some highlights are included at the bottom of this document.
This note is meant to give perspective from someone who recently (applied in 2016-2017) went through the process applying of PhD programs in computer science and because some friends recently decided to apply and keep asking me the same questions.

## Deciding Where to Apply

In applying to graduate school, a necessary step is deciding to which school you will apply to.

The number of schools you should apply to will depend on your circumstances.
Applying to anywhere between three to ten schools is normal, and I would not recommend applying to more than ten schools.
The cost in applying to more schools is (1) sending your materials (GRE scores, transcripts) (2) application fees.
In computer science, interviews are largely done remotely, though there are exceptions (e.g. Johns Hopkins).

### Methods

There are numerous ways to go about where to apply, but as the main reason to apply to grad school is to do research, the type of research done by faculty should be the prime consideration in deciding where to apply.
To that end, I would recommend:

- Talk to people in the field you are interested in and ask for a list of researchers and/or schools that they think do good research
- Look at papers you like and see who authored and from where. Then, crawl the citation graph (look at the related works section of papers you like for more papers you like).
- Look at the types of conferences you would want to be publishing in and see who is publishing there. Pay particular attention to papers receiving awards.

### Considerations

- Number of faculty
- Senior versus junior researcher
- Other signals
    - How often and where are the students publishing
- Which school or program within a university to apply to
    - NYU: data science versus computer science

## Putting Together the Application

After determining where you would to apply, you need to put the application together. Applications generally consist of statement of purpose, recommendation letter, GRE scores, application form.

### Statement of Purpose

The statement of purpose

### Recommendation Letters

Most schools will ask you for at least three letters of recommendation.
Ideally these letters will be from professors you have done research with in the past, e.g. during your undergrad or master's, during REUs or other research internships, etc.
It is difficult to do serious research with three different professors, 
- class project
- manager at a company who is familiar with your work.

### GREs

Most schools will also ask you for GRE scores.
Most computer science programs will only ask you for the general GRE and not require any subject GRE scores.

## Fellowships

### NSF

### NDSEG

### Hertz

### Other

- Soros
- Non-American
