# Who This Post is For 

This note is intended for people that have already decided to apply to PhD programs or are generally interested in seeing what the process entails.
This note does not provide advice as to whether or not you _should_ go to graduate school.
The perspective of this note is from someone who recently went through the process of applying to U.S.-based PhD programs in computer science (applied in Fall 2016).
There are a lot of resources for both deciding to go to grad school and actually applying to grad school.
Some highlights are included at the bottom of this document.

## Deciding Where to Apply

A necessary step in applying to grad school is deciding to which schools you will apply to.
I would recommend doing this before or in parallel with preparing your application.
Most schools have similar applications, but in case a school has unique application requirements, you will want to know in advance.

### How Do I Find Places to Consider Applying?

High-quality researchers are spread out across hundreds of institutions, and it is very likely that you are not aware of dozens of locations doing research that you are interested in.
To find an initial candidate set of places you might consider applying to, I would recommend.

- Talk to people in the field you are interested in and ask for a list of researchers and/or schools that they think do good research in your field of interest. If you do not have access to people in the field, try browsing [Quora](TODO:add example link) or Twitter. A last resort might be to look at [...]
- Look at papers you like and see who authored them and what institution they are from. In machine learning, the norm is for the most senior researcher to be listed last. If you want more papers to look at, crawl the citation graph (look at the related works section of a paper to find more interesting papers).
- Look at conferences and journals you would want to be publishing in and see who is publishing there. For machine learning, conferences are the main publication venue; popular ones include ICML, NIPS (currently undergoing a name change), ICLR, and AISTATS. For natural language processing, popular conferences include ACL and EMNLP.

### What Should I Consider in Deciding Where to Apply?

After gathering an initial list of places you are interested in, you will likely need to winnow down your list. In narrowing down schools, I would keep in mind the following factors:

- *Research fit*: as the main reason to you should want to attend grad school is to do research, the type of research done at an institution should be the prime consideration in deciding whether or not to apply there. I think research fit also includes the following considerations:
    - _Research areas_: are the faculty at this institution doing research you are interested in? Skim their recent papers (usually listed on their academic sites; if not, try Google Scholar); are they exciting to you?
    - _PI career stage_: at what career stage is the PI? Broadly speaking, researchers earlier in their career are more hands-on, while more senior researchers are less hands-on and are more established.
    In practice what this difference means is that early-career mentors will likely push harder to publish work and will check-in with students more frequently to make that happen. They also might have their own set of projects that they want their students to work on, which might be good if you are broadly interested in an area but don't have a clear enough view of the field to know what is interesting or impactful to work on. On the flip side, this might mean you have less time to work on what is personally interesting to you, if those interests don't align with the mentor's projects.
    Working with a PI later in their career has the benefit that their name and reputation is more widely recognized, meaning they likely have more and more flexible funding, and have stronger connections to other researchers in the field (which can be useful when you are searching for internships or jobs). The tradeoff is that there might be less pressure from the PI to publish and you might receive less attention, as more senior researchers have more outside obligations (giving talks, serving on panels, etc.).
    Do note that the aforementioned differences are generalities, and may not be true of a particular lab. The best way to know about the nature of a particular PI or their group is to talk to members of that group.
    - Size of group: how large is the PI's group, including PhD students, postdocs, master's students, and posisbly undergrads? A small group is around five PhD students (per PI, in cases of joint advising) with one or two postdocs, which averages out to about one PhD student per year. A large group would consist of around 2 or more PhD students per PI per year, plus postdocs.
    PhD students are usually the main focus of a PI's mentoring, but generally a larger group means that you will receive less individual attention. On the other hand, a large group means more opportunity to collaborate and receive guidance, particularly from postdocs and more senior students (though they will likely be learning how to properly mentor).
- *Research quality*: of course, you want to be doing high-quality and impactful research, [...]. I think useful signal of high-quality work is:
    - _Student publishing_: how often and where are the students of the group publishing? Publishing at one major conference per year is about average for machine learning (though the pace has increased in recent years, 
    - _Faculty and student awards_: an obvious signal of high-quality work is awards and fellowships earned by the principal researcher and other members of the group. Although these are nice-to-haves, I would not weigh it against a group if they lacked community awards, since only a handful of people earn awards despite the fact that hundreds, of researchers are consistently doing high-quality and interesting work every year. 
- *Institutional Factors*:
    - _Number of faculty_: how many faculty are at the institution doing research you are interested in? Computer science faculty are in a fairly unique position of constantly being courted by industry and other non-academic organizations, 
    - Differences beteen programs and departments _within_ a university: this is not a reason to apply / not apply to a university, so much as possible university-specific quirks worth being aware of. For example, for someone applying to Carnegie Mellon University for NLP programs, there are three different departments that one might apply to (Computer Science, Machine Learning, Language Technologies Institute). At New York University, there is a traditional Computer Science department and a new Center for Data Science with many faculty having appointments in both (in fact the two departments are located right next to each other). The differences between departments vary between institutions and can range from different course requirements, access to faculty (either physical, e.g. they located in distant buildings and it is difficult to collaborate, or administratively, e.g. you are only allowed to work with faculty in your department). It is worth being aware of these differences and contacting people at the university if they are unclear.
- Life fit: you want to be happy in grad school, which includes being happy with your situation outside of research. Everyone's situation is different, but some factors that mattered to me included:
    - location: would you be happy living near that graduate school? Rural/urban; learning language; do you know people there already?



### How Many Places Should I Apply To?

The number of schools you should apply to will depend on your circumstances.
Applying to anywhere between three to ten schools is normal, and I would not recommend applying to more than ten schools.
The time cost in applying to more schools is not trivial.
The financial cost in applying to more schools is also nontrivial (I would estimate ~$100/school) and mostly comes from (1) fees from sending your application materials (GRE scores, transcripts) (2) application fees.
Fortunately in computer science, interviews are largely done remotely (visit days are usually after decisions are made, in my experience, though there are exceptions), so you do not need to worry about paying to fly to schools for interviews.


## Putting Together the Application

After determining where you would to apply, you need to put the application together. Applications generally consist of statement of purpose, recommendation letter, GRE scores, application form.

### Statement of Purpose

The statement of purpose

### Recommendation Letters

Most schools will ask you for at least three letters of recommendation.
Ideally these letters will be from professors you have done research with in the past, e.g. during your undergrad or master's, during REUs or other research internships, etc.
It is difficult to do serious research with three different professors, 
- class project
- manager at a company who is familiar with your work.

### GREs

Most schools will also ask you for GRE scores.
Most computer science programs will only ask you for the general GRE and not require any subject GRE scores.
