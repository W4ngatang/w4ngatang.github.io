# Who This is For 

This blog post is intended for people interested that have already decided to apply to graduate school (PhD programs) or are generally interested in seeing what the process entails.

There are a lot of resources for both deciding to go to grad school and actually applying to grad school.
Some highlights are included at the bottom of this document.
This note focuses on the latter and is meant to give perspective from someone who recently (applied in Fall 2016) went through the process applying to PhD programs in computer science.

## Deciding Where to Apply

A necessary step is deciding to which school you will apply to.
I would recommend doing this before or in parallel with preparing your application.
Most schools have similar applications, but in the chance that a school has unique application requirements, you will want to know in advance.

### How Do I Find Places to Consider Applying?

There are numerous ways to go about where to apply, but as the main reason to you should want to attend grad school is to do research, the type of research done by faculty should be the prime consideration in deciding where to apply.
To that end, I would recommend:

- Talk to people in the field you are interested in and ask for a list of researchers and/or schools that they think do good research. If you do not have access to people in the field, try browsing [Quora](TODO:add example link) or Twitter.
- Look at papers you like and see who authored and what institution they are from. In machine learning, the norm is for the most senior researcher to be listed last. If you want more papers to look at, crawl the citation graph (look at the related works section of papers you like for more papers you like).
- Look at the types of conferences you would want to be publishing in and see who is publishing there. Pay particular attention to papers receiving awards.

### What Should I Consider in Deciding Where to Apply?

- Number of faculty
- Senior versus junior researcher
- Other signals
    - How often and where are the students publishing
- Differences between programs and departments _within_ a university
    - NYU: data science versus computer science

### How Many Places Should I Apply?

The number of schools you should apply to will depend on your circumstances.
Applying to anywhere between three to ten schools is normal, and I would not recommend applying to more than ten schools.
The time cost in applying to more schools is not trivial.
The financial cost in applying to more schools is also nontrivial and mostly comes from (1) fees from sending your application materials (GRE scores, transcripts) (2) application fees.
Fortunately in computer science, interviews are largely done remotely (visit days are largely after decisions are made, in my experience, though there are exceptions), so you do not need to worry about paying to fly to schools for interviews.


## Putting Together the Application

After determining where you would to apply, you need to put the application together. Applications generally consist of statement of purpose, recommendation letter, GRE scores, application form.

### Statement of Purpose

The statement of purpose

### Recommendation Letters

Most schools will ask you for at least three letters of recommendation.
Ideally these letters will be from professors you have done research with in the past, e.g. during your undergrad or master's, during REUs or other research internships, etc.
It is difficult to do serious research with three different professors, 
- class project
- manager at a company who is familiar with your work.

### GREs

Most schools will also ask you for GRE scores.
Most computer science programs will only ask you for the general GRE and not require any subject GRE scores.
